        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground 
        meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served 
        with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, 
        mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island 
        dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is 
        called a cheeseburger.</p>

        <p>The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United 
        Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground 
        beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed 
        with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison 
        burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Australia and New Zealand, a piece of 
        chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be 
        considered to be a burger in the United States; where it would generally be called a 
        chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires 
        sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich.</p>
